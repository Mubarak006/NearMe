         This town is known for the Tiruttani Murugan Temple, which is a significant pilgrimage site for devotees of the Hindu god of war, Kartikeya. The temple is one of the six Arupadaiveedu, which are the most important abodes of Murugan. During the Sangam era, Tiruttani was called Kundruthoradal.
